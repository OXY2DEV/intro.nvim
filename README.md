>[!IMPORTANT]
> ~~So, Neovim just released `0.10` and I probably won't get my hands on it any time soon(because Termux package updates can be slow sometimes). So, most likely the plugin won't be updated to `0.10`.~~
>
> I have managed to install 0.10 and am working on the plugin now.
>
> On the bright side, this gives me more time to polish the plugin, add more presets, finish the documentation and other chores.


~~As such, I wouldn't recommend installing the plugin if you are on `0.10`, unless you want to see a bunch of deprecation warnings. Really sorry for that but there's really not much I can do about it. I will still try to see if I can install the latest version somehow, but no promises.~~
