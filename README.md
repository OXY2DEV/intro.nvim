> [! IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is still in it's **early stages** so various parts of the plugin may go through changes.
> 
> This is a **hobby project** and I am not a **professional developer**. So, my approach to various features in the plugin may not be the most optimal solution. Thus, if someone can provide better solution I am more than happy to implement it.

>[! BUG]
>If you are installing the plugin I suggest first using the example in the `installation` section and check if the plugin works.
>
>This plugin was completely written inside **Termux**(as in, on my phone) and tested inside **Termux** & **xfce4-terminal**. So, I can't help you fix a bug unless **sufficient information** is provided when the plugin doesn't work. Especially, when the bug may occurs due to your **terminal** or **another plugin** that you use.
